In the business world, companies often have a hard time keeping skilled employees, and one major issue is rising employee turnover, also called HR attrition. High turnover can negatively affect a company’s productivity and stability. It leads to higher costs for hiring and training new staff, disrupts team dynamics, and causes the loss of valuable company knowledge. Therefore, it’s important to understand what causes employees to leave and to create effective strategies to keep them in order to remain competitive.

### Objectives of the Analysis

1. **Understand Current Turnover Rates**: Get a clear picture of how many employees are leaving and analyze the attrition based on different factors like age, gender, education, department, and job role.

2. **Identify Key Factors Influencing Turnover**: Look into the main reasons why employees leave, including job satisfaction (like how engaged they feel and their work-life balance), salary factors (such as monthly income and pay raises), and benefits (like stock options), to find patterns that lead to higher turnover rates.
